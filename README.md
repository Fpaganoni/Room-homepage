🛍️ E-commerce Product Page - Frontend Mentor Challenge
🌟 Project Overview
This project is the implementation of an e-commerce product page (homepage), completed as part of a challenge from the Frontend Mentor platform. The main goal was to replicate the proposed design (in both mobile and desktop versions) with the highest fidelity possible, focusing on responsive design and interactivity using JavaScript.

💻 Technologies Used
HTML5: For the semantic structure of the content.
CSS3: For styling and implementing the responsive layout.
JavaScript: For managing the product image gallery (slider) and handling UI interactions (like the shopping cart or navigation).
✨ Key Features
Users of the page should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size (mobile, tablet, or desktop).
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page (buttons, links, images, etc.) for a better user experience.
Navigate the product image slider using either the mouse/trackpad or the keyboard.
Interact with the navigation menu and the shopping cart (simulated functionality).
⚙️ Development Process
1. Planning and Structure
The design (mobile and desktop JPGs) and the style guide (style-guide.md) were analyzed to define the color palette, typography, and spacing.
A semantic HTML structure was created, focusing on content first before adding any styles.
2. Styling and Responsiveness
Base styles were established (fonts, global colors).
The design was implemented following a mobile-first approach to ensure excellent viewing on smaller devices.
Media queries were used to adapt the layout to desktop screens, achieving full responsive design.
Special attention was paid to CSS details to match the pixel-perfect design, using best judgment for font-size, padding, and margin.
3. Interactivity (JavaScript)
The logic for slider navigation was developed, allowing the user to switch between product images.
Event listeners were implemented to handle interactive states, such as hover on slider thumbnails and basic UI functionality (opening/closing the menu and cart).
4. Deployment
The project was initialized as a public GitHub repository.
The repository was configured to publish the code to a live web address using VERCEL to facilitate review and use.
